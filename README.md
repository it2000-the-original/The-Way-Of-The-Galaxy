# The-Way-Of-The-Galaxy
A game written in C++ with the SDL library

The Way Of The Galaxy is an open source game written in c++ with the sdl visual studio library and cmake, it promises to be multi-platform and aims to have the most optimized programming possible despite the fact that the project is currently very light. At the moment it's still under development and it's still far from being what I want it to be, but it's getting closer and closer to the desired result and it's not encountering particularly difficult obstacles. It is a fantasy and at the same time adventure game that aims to have a plot and to be organized in levels, this game is inspired by Konami's Gradius and the 16-bit games of the 80s/90s.
